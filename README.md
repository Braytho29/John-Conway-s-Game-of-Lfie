# John-Conway-s-Game-of-Lfie <br/> 

This was a university assignment and I believe it was a suitable piece of my work that highlghts my skills in C# programming. <br/><br/>
Functionality: <br/> 
- User is able to input conditions that the game must follow
- Each generation can run continuously after a certain amount of time or the user can step through each generation
- The game can take in an input file which will be the starting generation 
- The game can output and save the final generation of the game
